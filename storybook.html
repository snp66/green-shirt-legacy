    <h1>A Green Shirt Family Christmas</h1>
    <p>By Scott Patti [cite: 2]</p>

    <div class="reader">
        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">My name is Green Shirt. I am a relic. A joke. A glorious, plaid monstrosity of the 1990s[cite: 3, 4]. My life, currently, is spent hanging in Austin, Texas, waiting[cite: 5]. Waiting for the one day a year I truly matter: Christmas[cite: 6].</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">I was born beneath a sparkling tree in the early 90s[cite: 8]. I was a $12 impulse buy from a defunct department store. I was a gift from Aunt Pat.</div>
            <p><strong>Young Chris:</strong> Uh... thanks, Aunt Pat? It's... green[cite: 10].</p>
            <div class="narration">Chris Patti, bless his heart, received me first[cite: 11]. He did not know the burden he had accepted[cite: 12].</div>
            <div class="page-num">Page 2</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">For three decades, I was passed between the Patti siblings—Chris, then Scott, then Alyssa—a perpetual, slightly itchy hot potato of holiday cheer[cite: 16]. But I am not just a flannel joke[cite: 17]. I possess a power. The Hook! The ability to snag onto anything and transport across space and time.</div>
            <div class="page-num">Page 3</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">I decided I needed answers. Was I truly unique? Or was I merely one of many Caldor green shirts? [cite: 22, 23] I needed to find my spiritual birthplace[cite: 24]. (Green Shirt hooks onto an airplane wing) Zzzzzwip! Austin to... wherever the internet thinks the last Caldor might be[cite: 24, 25].</div>
            <p><strong>Green Shirt:</strong> Ah, this must be it. The majestic, long-gone Mecca of mid-tier retail. The last surviving Caldor sign is barely legible[cite: 28, 29].</p>
            <div class="page-num">Page 5</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">No other shirts were here. Only ghosts of forgotten bargains. But wait... what is this? [cite: 30] A mockery! A shrine! A photo album covered entirely in my signature green plaid pattern. They've turned me into a visual meme! [cite: 33, 34] I am a theme! [cite: 35]</div>
            <div class="narration">And there's more! An ornament! A truly terrible jigsaw puzzle! Did I bring them joy, or just inspire low-cost, high-effort craft projects? [cite: 35, 36]</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">I had to keep moving. The more I traveled, the more evidence I found of my baffling cult status[cite: 38]. I hooked onto a utility pole and zipped westward[cite: 39]. Now they've codified me! A song? Written for a flannel shirt? [cite: 39, 40]</div>
            <div class="page-num">Page 7</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">Ah, the pinnacle of the joke gift. The classic bait-and-switch. The promise of cutting-edge technology... delivered via 100% cotton flannel[cite: 45, 46].</div>
            <p><strong>Green Shirt:</strong> I am the gift that keeps disappointing[cite: 47]. I am the physical manifestation of low expectations[cite: 48].</p>
            <div class="page-num">Page 8</div>
        </div>

        <div class="page">
            <div class="narration">I realized I am not special because I was mass-produced by Caldor[cite: 51]. I am special because I am the Green Shirt. The one that means laughter, memory, and tradition[cite: 52]. My purpose is here. Now, I wait patiently for Christmas morning... and the moment I get to disappoint someone new[cite: 53, 54].</div>
